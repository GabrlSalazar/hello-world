# hello-world

Just an intro for myself in this new world i'm diving in known as ''Programming''.

Me, well, i'm just trying to get better knowledge and understanding of how programing works, I want to create useful apps that help us on a day to day basis, whether is communicating, transporting, getting information, storing information, entretaining, and all the things that we struggle with every day, I just want to make people's lifes easier but yet fullfilling.
